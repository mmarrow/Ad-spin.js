# Ad-spin.js
This is JavaScript I wrote for a site to randomize side bar advertisements and hide overflow based on page height. Will rewrite to make a plugin.

This currently utilizes the shuffle.js jquery plugin.


Todo:

- Rewrite in vanilla JS
- Add separation of concerns (SoC)  
    * Randomize
    * Shuffle
    * Hide

More to come...
